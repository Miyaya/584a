# INF584A
## Crucial Problem
All the trainings and buildings are going simultaneously, usually there will be 2 larvae morphing into drones together and 2 drones into spawning pools together, which may result in 1 extra drone and 1 extra spawning pool
## Currently vailable functions 
1. Train 6 drones (might be 7 due to the problem above)
2. ```Currently disabled``` Train overlords when there's not enough control
3. Build 1 spawning pool (might be 2 due to the problem above)
4. Train 6 Zerglings (might be 4 or 8 due to the problem above)
